# VLSI
Design &amp; Layout Implementation of an Error Code Detection and Correction Circuit in 65nm Technology - Cadence Virutoso.

•	The layout of all standard cells is designed and manually placed in the decoder and FSM by optimizing the area.
•	Optimized the circuit for minimum Area Delay Product and achieved maximum clock frequency of 2 GHz.
•	Design is implemented, analyzed, and verified using HSPICE simulation.
